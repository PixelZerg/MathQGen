# MathQGen
#### A modular maths questions generator in C<span>#</span>

Uses LaTeX (MathJax) and/or HTML renderers to display the questions. (HTML supports css, javascript, images, etc...).
Use the friendly API (with documentation!) to create .dll plugins for this program and they will appear, sorted by namespace and complexity in the program's user interface -- the complexity of the plugin is evaluated from timing the execution time of the plugin.

Clean user interface with Metro Framework and greatly statisfying, smooth animations (which can be configured in the settings tab).
